Closure is formed when functions are bundled with their lexical environment. Meaning inner function has access to the varibales and params of their outer or parent function.

example:

function outer(a){ //1
    function inner(b) //2
        function innermost(c) //3
              console.log(a+b+c);  // 6
}

Advantages:
1. currying
2. memoize
